## WHO AM I

ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Piyush Yadav, a full-stack software engineer from India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ with one year of professional experience and three Years of Personal Projects. My pronouns are he/him.

I focus on details and I'm passionate about crafting software products that look great and are both accessible and easy to maintain.

I'm all about diving into challenges improving and expanding my skillset and I thrive in globally-remote teams that value people and embrace trust, kindness, and inclusion.

I consider myself a curious and inquisitive person, so on my spare time I like to work on [side projects](/projects), try to contribute to open source software and aim to constantly learn something new to improve my skillset.
