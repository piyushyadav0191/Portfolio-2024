## WHO AM I

I'm a full-stack developer in [India](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JSbQSpLmKjax8Ghx5). I am creative and passionate about design and technology so I always try to craft great-looking software products.

Before getting into software development, I wanted to make some real time Web Applications. When I started programming my first Applications, I realized what my real passion was and started learning more about software development.

When not coding, I like to watch TV shows and movies, play some games with friends or hang out with them. I'm also **listening to music** most of the time. According to Spotify Wrapped, I listened to 989 minutes of music in 2023 and 3047 in 2022. 😁

I consider myself a curious and inquisitive person, so on my spare time I like to work on [side projects](/projects), try to contribute to open source software and aim to constantly learn something new to improve my skillset.

And last but not least, please don't hesitate to [contact me](/contact)!
